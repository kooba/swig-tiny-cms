##Installation

```sh
npm install swig-tiny-cms --save
```

##Configuration

Require Swig CMS
```js
var swigCms = require('swig-tiny-cms');
```

After typical Express and Swig configuration, provide a way for Swig CMS to know when user is authorized to edit content via middleware.

```js
app.use(function(req, res, next){
  swigCms.isAdmin(req.isAuthenticated());
  next();
});
```

Provide bower component root folder within swig-cms options:

```js
var options = {
  //content directory is required. Should be a shared location when used in a clustered environment.
  contentDirectory: __dirname + '/content/',

  //optionally pass list of css files that should be used in editor.
  //this will allow you to match editor's preview with your site's rendering.
  css: ['//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootswatch/3.1.1-1/css/simplex/bootstrap.min.css'],

  //optionally set marked render engine options. More info https://github.com/chjj/marked
  markedOptions: { breaks: true }
};
```

Initialize Swig CMS

```js
swigCms.initialize(swig, app, options);
```
